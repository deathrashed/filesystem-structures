# Johnny.Decimal Structure System

The Johnny.Decimal system is a numeric organization framework that provides a unique identifier for every item in your filesystem, making navigation, search, and recall significantly easier.

## Core Principles

- **Areas**: Broad division of your system (e.g., 10-19 Finance)
- **Categories**: Specific sections within an area (e.g., 11 Tax Returns)
- **IDs**: Individual identifiers for files/folders (e.g., 11.01 2024 Tax Return)

## Number Structure

- **Areas**: Assigned a range (e.g., 10-19, 20-29)
- **Categories**: Assigned a specific number within the area range (e.g., 11, 12, 13...)
- **IDs**: Decimal extensions of categories (e.g., 11.01, 11.02, 11.03...)

## Benefits

- **Unambiguous**: Each location has a unique numeric ID
- **Memorable**: Humans remember numbers well, especially in this structured pattern
- **Searchable**: Easy to find items by typing their ID
- **Navigable**: Simple to maintain and understand folder hierarchy
- **Flexible**: Can be adapted to any content or domain

## Implementation Notes

- Never use more than 10 areas (00-99) or 10 categories per area
- Keep a master index of your decimal system for reference
- Begin IDs with the same numbers as their parent category
- Use for both digital and physical organization (e.g., notebook pages)
